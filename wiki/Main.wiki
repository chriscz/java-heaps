= Introduction =
OK, so back in undergrad I did a project on maximum flows/minimum cuts and decided (for some reason) that the heap was favorite data structure. This project contains several different flavors of heap: Binary, binomial, pairing, leftist, Fibonacci, and Skew. 

This project was officially moved to Google code on 10/29/2009; I need to do some cleanup work to make everything happy. Basically, there are/were a few little refactoring jobs I've been meaning to do; the source code formatting is a little crazy; I need to fix up the build  file (currently Ant, although I'd like to add a Maven POM file, as well); and I'm still working on building a 2-3 heap implementation. 

In any case, if you've come across this project and really want to download something NOW, you can visit this project's old site at:
